# GameEngine

### Multiplatform Game engine

## Build

Compile the project with:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

It will generate a platform-specific build system for your project.

To compile it for example with linux makefiles:

```bash
cd build
make
```

It can be more complicated on winodws for example.
